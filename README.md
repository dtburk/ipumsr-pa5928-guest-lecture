# ipumsr-webinar

This repository hosts the presentation files for the IPUMS webinar on the 
ipumsr package from 10/12/2021. It is a fork of gergness/ipumsr-tcrug, which is 
a presentation on ipumsr developed by Greg Freedman Ellis for the Twin Cities 
R User Group.

A recording of this webinar, a PDF version of the slides, and answers to all 
questions asked during the webinar are available on the 
[IPUMS Tutorials page](https://www.ipums.org/support/tutorials). 

The code used to generate the slides is in "ipumsr_webinar.Rmd". The HTML 
version of the slides in "ipumsr_webinar.html" is built from the RMD file using 
the R package [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
