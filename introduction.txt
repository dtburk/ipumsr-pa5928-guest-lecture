Welcome, everyone, to this webinar on using IPUMS data in R with 
ipumsr. We only have an hour, and we want to leave time for questions at the 
end, so this will be a whirlwind tour of some of the key features of ipumsr. 

Our goal is to get you excited about analyzing IPUMS data using ipumsr, and
point you to additional resources to explore on your own. As you use ipumsr, you
are bound to have questions, and at the end we will provide links to several
places where you can seek help, including by reaching out to our excellent IPUMS
user support team or posting a question on the IPUMS user forum.

We will also share with you the webinar recording, these slides, and all of the
code used to build this presentation, so there's no need to frantically jot down
notes during the webinar itself. You should, however, type any questions in the
Q&A as they occur to you, and our user support expert Grace will either answer
them or add them to the list to be answered at the end.

Finally, I just want to acknowledge that the ipumsr package was created by Greg
Freedman Ellis, and this webinar is based on a presentation created by Greg, so
thanks to Greg for creating a great package, and for letting us use your slides.

With that, we'll get started by briefly introducing ourselves. You'll primarily 
be hearing from me and Dan, but the development of the webinar was a 
collaborative effort between Dan, Kara, and myself.
