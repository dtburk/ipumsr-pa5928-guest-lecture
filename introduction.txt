Hello everyone, and thanks for having us, we're excited to join you today to
talk about using IPUMS data in R with ipumsr. We want to leave time for
questions at the end, so this will be a whirlwind tour of some of the key
features of ipumsr.

Our goal is to get you excited about analyzing IPUMS data using ipumsr, and
point you to additional resources to explore on your own. As you use ipumsr, you
are bound to have questions, and at the end we will provide links to several
places where you can seek help, including by reaching out to our excellent IPUMS
user support team or posting a question on the IPUMS user forum.

I believe your instructor has already shared a PDF version of these slides with
you, and you will have access to a recording of this presentation, as well as
the code used to build this presentation. I'm not sure how we're handling 
questions, but perhaps your instructor can interrupt us if there is a question 
before the Q&A period at the end of the presentation.

Finally, I just want to acknowledge that the ipumsr package was created by Greg
Freedman Ellis, and this webinar is based on a presentation created by Greg, so
thanks to Greg for creating a great package, and for letting us use your slides.

With that, we'll get started by briefly introducing ourselves.
