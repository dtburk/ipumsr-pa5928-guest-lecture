# Setting up R

## Setting up R
- https://rstudio.cloud/project/18776

- Hopefully you can use rstudio.cloud to avoid any setup, 
  but if you'd like to setup on your own machine, the slides
  below explain:

## Installing ipumsr
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ipumsr")
```

- Or if you want the development version (which is what I'm 
  using), use:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mnpopcenter/ipumsr")
```

## Other packages
- Some of the examples below also rely on the development version of
  ggplot2 and a few extra packages.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("shiny", "DT")) # For ipums_view()

install.packages("sf") # For the geography examples 
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")

install.packages("revealjs") # For this presentation
```

# Loading data
## Setup R session
- Now that we're all set up, we'll use these libraries
```{r}
library(ipumsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(sf)
```

## Loading data
- Using commands `read_ipums_ddi()` and `read_ipums_micro()`
```{r}
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("usa_00013.xml")

data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
```

## Available metadata
- Some (but not all) of the documentation comes with the ddi.
```{r}
ipums_var_label(ddi, PHONE)

ipums_var_desc(ddi, PHONE) %>% strwrap(60)
```

## Available metadata
```{r}
ipums_val_labels(ddi, PHONE)
```

## A nicer view of metadata
- `ipums_view()` makes a nicely formatted static html page for 
  just your extract using htmltools.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ipums_view(ddi)
```

## Data
A regular `tbl_df` data.frame
```{r}
data
```

# Wrangling value labels

## Wrangling value labels
- IPUMS value labels don't translate that well to R's factors.

    - (Factors always have a label, and always have values starting at 1)
  
- So `ipumsr` imports them as `haven::labelled()` objects, which aren't
  always the easiest to deal with.

- Luckily ipumsr provides helpers that allow you to use information
  from both the value and label

```{r, include = FALSE}
label_before_after <- function(df, before_var, after_var, label_fun) {
  before_var <- rlang::enquo(before_var)
  after_var <- rlang::enquo(after_var)

  
  freqs <- df %>% 
    mutate(val = !!before_var) %>%
    group_by(val) %>%
    summarize(count = n()) 
  
  all_vals <- ipums_val_labels(df, !!before_var) %>% pull(val)
  attributes(all_vals) <- attributes(df %>% pull(!!before_var))
  
  unique_val_df <- dplyr::data_frame(val = all_vals) %>%
    mutate(
      after = label_fun(val),
      `before ([val] label)` = as_factor(val, "both")
    ) %>%
    filter(after %in% levels(df %>% pull(!!after_var)) | is.na(after))
  
  attributes(unique_val_df$val) <- NULL
  attributes(freqs$val) <- NULL
  
  out <- left_join(unique_val_df, freqs, by = "val") %>%
    mutate(count = ifelse(is.na(count), 0, count)) %>%
    select(`before ([val] label)`, after, count)
  
  out %>%
    DT::datatable(
      rownames = FALSE, 
      filter = "none", 
      options = list(
        searching = FALSE, 
        scrollY = "200px",
        scrollCollapse = TRUE,
        paging = FALSE,
        bInfo = FALSE
      )
    )
}
```

## `as_factor()`
- `as_factor()` (from haven) converts directly to a factor.

```{r}
ipums_val_labels(data$GQ)
```

## `as_factor()` 
- Suppose we want to keep these labels exactly as they are.

```{r}
data$GQ2 <- as_factor(data$GQ)
```

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
label_before_after(data, GQ, GQ2, as_factor)
```


## `lbl_clean()`
- `lbl_clean()` gets rid of unused value labels.

```{r}
ipums_val_labels(data$STATEFIP)
```

## `lbl_clean()`
- Since our extract only has Minnesota, we don't want all of
 these values.

```{r}
data$STATEFIP2 <- data$STATEFIP %>% 
  lbl_clean() %>% 
  as_factor()
```

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
label_before_after(data, STATEFIP, STATEFIP2, . %>% lbl_clean() %>% as_factor())
```

## `lbl_na_if()`
- `lbl_na_if()` allows you to set certain values or labels 
  to missing.

```{r}
ipums_val_labels(data$PHONE)
```

## `lbl_na_if()`
- Easier to use R's `NA` data structure to deal with missing values
  like "N/A" and "Suppressed".

```{r}
data$PHONE2 <- lbl_na_if(data$PHONE, ~.val %in% c(0, 8)) %>%
  as_factor()
```

. . . 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
label_before_after(
  data, 
  PHONE, 
  PHONE2,
  . %>% 
    lbl_na_if(~.val %in% c(0, 8)) %>%
    as_factor()
)
```

## `lbl_na_if()`
- It works with both values (`.val`) and labels (`.lbl`).
  So we could have also written something like this:
```{r}
drop_labels <- c("N/A", "Suppressed (2012 and 2015 ACS)")

data$PHONE3 <- lbl_na_if(data$PHONE, ~.lbl %in% drop_labels) %>%
  as_factor()
```

## `lbl_collapse()`
- `lbl_collapse()` allows you to take advantage of the hierarchical
  structure of value labels.
```{r}
ipums_val_labels(data$EDUCD)
```


## `lbl_collapse()`
- Maybe this is too much detail, so we want to collapse 
  the last digit.

```{r}
data$EDUCD2 <- lbl_collapse(data$EDUCD, ~.val %/% 10) %>%
  as_factor()
```

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
label_before_after(
  data, 
  EDUCD, 
  EDUCD2,
  . %>% lbl_collapse(~.val %/% 10) %>%
    as_factor()
)
```

## `lbl_relabel()`
- `lbl_relabel()` has more granular control of what the values are assigned to.

```{r}
levels(data$EDUCD2)
```

## `lbl_relabel()`
- Maybe the education variable is still too specific.

```{r}
data$EDUCD3 <- data$EDUCD %>%
  lbl_collapse(~.val %/% 10) %>% 
  lbl_relabel(
    lbl(2, "Less than High School") ~.val > 0 & .val < 6,
    lbl(3, "High school") ~.lbl == "Grade 12",
    lbl(4, "Some college") ~str_detect(.lbl, "^[123] year(s)? of college$"),
    lbl(5, "College or more") ~.val %in% c(10, 11)
  ) %>%
  as_factor()
```

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
label_before_after(
  data, 
  EDUCD, 
  EDUCD3,
  . %>%
    lbl_collapse(~.val %/% 10) %>% 
    lbl_relabel(
      lbl(2, "Less than High School") ~.val > 0 & .val < 6,
      lbl(3, "High school") ~.lbl == "Grade 12",
      lbl(4, "Some college") ~str_detect(.lbl, "^[123] year(s)? of college$"),
      lbl(5, "College or more") ~.val %in% c(10, 11)
    ) %>%
    as_factor()
)
```

# Using data
## Phone availability 
- Now that they're factors, ready for use as regular R data
```{r graph1, eval = FALSE}
graph_data <- data %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize(`% with phone` = weighted.mean(
    PHONE2 == "Yes, phone available", PERWT, na.rm = TRUE
  ))

ggplot(graph_data, aes(x = YEAR, y = `% with phone`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Percent of Minnesota with phone line",
    subtitle = paste0("Data source: ", ddi$ipums_project),
    caption = paste(strwrap(ipums_var_desc(ddi, PHONE), 90), collapse = "\n")
  )
```


## Phone availability
```{r graph1, echo = FALSE}
```

## Interpretation

> The 2008 ACS and 2008 PRCS instructed respondents to include cell 
> phone service; prior to 2008, this was not made explicit.
> 
> - https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/PHONE#comparability_section

## Phone availability by education
```{r graph2, eval = FALSE}
graph_data <- data %>%
  group_by(YEAR, EDUCD3) %>%
  summarize(`% with phone` = weighted.mean(
    PHONE2 == "Yes, phone available", PERWT, na.rm = TRUE
  )) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(graph_data, aes(x = YEAR, y = `% with phone`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~EDUCD3) + 
  labs(
    title = "Percent of Minnesota with phone line by education",
    subtitle = paste0("Data source: ", ddi$ipums_project)
  )
```

## Phone availability by education
```{r graph2, echo = FALSE}
```

# Geographic data
## Getting geographic data
- For IPUMS USA (and several other projects), we provide geographic
  boundaries as well. For many areas, this includes harmonizing
  boundary changes over time.

- In our extract we included CONSPUMA, so let's checkout the 
  description on the website 
  (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/tgeotools.shtml)
  about it.

- Note that CONSPUMA is a rather large geography, if you 
  want finer geographic detail, you need to hope that
  NHGIS has the table you want.

## Loading shape data
- `ipumsr` provides support for both sf and sp data, but I find the sf
  package much easier to use.

- To use, use the `ipums_read_sf()` function. (Mostly just a wrapper around
  `sf::read_sf`).


```{r}
shape_data <- read_ipums_sf("shape/")
```

## Joining shape data
- We also provide helpers for merging data that work with both sf
  and sp packages. 

```{r}
conspuma_data <- data %>%
  group_by(CONSPUMA, YEAR) %>%
  summarize(PHONE = weighted.mean(
    PHONE2 == "Yes, phone available", PERWT, na.rm = TRUE
  ))

conspuma_data <- ipums_shape_inner_join(
  conspuma_data, 
  shape_data, 
  by = "CONSPUMA"
)
```

## Plotting shape data
- With the development version of ggplot2, can plot sf data:
```{r graph3, eval = FALSE}
graph_data <- conspuma_data %>% 
  filter(YEAR %in% c(1980, 1990, 2000, 2010))

ggplot(graph_data, aes(fill = PHONE)) +
  facet_wrap(~YEAR) + 
  geom_sf()
```

## Plotting shape data
```{r graph3, echo = FALSE}
```
